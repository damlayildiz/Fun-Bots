# Fun-Bots
This repository is a collection of scripts I wrote for myself and my friends to surprise them and also to solve simple problems in our lives. These scripts are no longer deployed and do not contain client_id's, tokens, emails, passwords and phone numbers. Also they lack files like requirements and procfiles that are necessary to deploy on Heroku. When they were alive, they had their own private repositories with all of the necessary files and information, so in a sense that this repository is a graveyard for my old bot scripts. 

## Reddit Game Bot
This is a simple script that sends an encrypted question to a Reddit user every 30 minutes until he/she solves and sends back the correct answer. Implemented with Python and Reddit API wrapper [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

## Eye Bleach Bot 
This is a simple script that everyday sends a SMS message with the top 3 posts that are hot in *r/eyebleach*. Implemented with Python, [Twilio's Rest API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api), and Reddit API wrapper [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

## Good Morning Bot
This is a simple script that sends a facebook message with a random greeting every morning. Implemented with Python and [Facebook chat API](https://fbchat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Happy Birthday Bot 
This is a simple Discord bot for one of my servers. It replies to `!bday person-name` with a yes or no depending on whether today is the birthday of that person. Implemented with Python and [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).
